# reddit-video-bot

A lot of people leave YouTube links in their comments, with no explanation about what the video is. You may not want to view the video without knowing its title and duration, so this bot is here to do just that.

It picks up YouTube links from comments, and generates a table consisting of the Video title, short description and duration. For example, if you post a comment on Reddit saying :

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=868l4s3EPLs

The bot will automatically reply in the following format
